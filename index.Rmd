Since I'm talking about data analysis in R, I cannot avoid talking about the tidyverse.

This diagram, you probably see it many times, resonates well with data scientists, because it points out the critical steps and the iterative nature of the analysis process.

You can find one of the tidyverse packages correspond to each of the modules here. The tidyverse basically helps with data analysis tidy and smooth in general.

But what this diagram doesn't tell you is they all share the same underlying data structure.

This "tidy" stage doesn't mean data cleaning, but actually means making the data in a right shape, a uniform shape that forms the basis for these three modules in this loop. Now, this kind of data shape is called "tidy data".

With the tidyverse, we have such a fluent pipeline to handle data analysis. But if you have ever done time series analysis in R, I hope this diagram resonates with you well ...

???

It is a messy-verse.

There are a few time series data classes in R, but all are designed purely for the modelling purpose, which means the object can be quite different from the data at the "import" stage. No formal organisation is provided on how to reshape the data for modelling, you'll go through such a lumpy path with luck.

Once the data is in the modelling shape, transformation and plotting are doable but not that tidy.

But this diagram only captures the workflow for relatively simple data set. If the data is more complex, for example, many series and many measurements, the diagram doesn't emphasize the difficulty enough.

This motivates the tsibble package that I'm going to talk about.

???

The goal of the tsibble package is to define tidy data in terms of temporal contexts, that is suitable for downstream analysis, like modeling or forecasting, and reduces the friction between data and models. It turns out tsibble is tidier than tidy data. I'll explain what I mean by tidier data later.

Tsibble alone can't do everything in this whole process. A broader picture here is we hope to tidy the time series workflow through the tidyverts ecosystem.

<hr>

What can tsibble do?

First of all, tsibble represents tidy temporal data.

A tsibble is first built on top of the tidy data principles. Tidy data is organised in the rectangular format: each row forms an observation; each column forms a variable. But temporal data is more of a contextual data object. We have introduced index and key to make the temporal context explicit. And the rest are measurements. But still this figure just describes the shape of a tsibble.

---

class: middle

.top[<img src="img/tsibble-semantics.png", height = "80px">]

## In *tsibble*:

1. Index is a variable with inherent ordering from past to present.
2. Key is a set of variables that define observational units over time.
3. Each observation should be uniquely identified by **index** and **key**.
4. Each observational unit should be measured at a common **interval**, if regularly spaced.

Tsibble is a data- and model-oriented object.

???

I said before tsibble is a tidier data, because

1. The index variable provides a contextual basis for temporal data. Tsibble supports the common ones: dates and date-times with inherent ordering, and others like intradays or numbers. Custom time classes can also be supported, as long as they can be ordered from past to future.
2. For example, if you're doing survey studies, the participants are the observational units forming the key. Or if you're looking at monthly energy use of households, the households form the key.
3. In other words, an observational unit can't allow for duplicated time stamps.
4. 

The 1st and 2nd bullet points make tsibble a data-centric object. And the 3rd and 4th make sure it can be probably analysed and modeled later.

Okay, how would these four points turn a data set into a tsibble. Time for an example.

The data set we're looking at is the on-time performance for domestic flights in the States. It's the same data source as the package `nycflights13`, but it's much bigger, not limited to NYC and also more recent. It's about 2017.

It's a medium-sized data set with 5M obs and 22 variables. (briefly describe the data)

It already arrives as tidy data, with clearly defined observations and variables. Now we need to declare them as temporal data using tsibble.

---

## Declare a tsibble

.details[
```{r try-tsibble, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
```
]

## <i class="fas fa-search"></i> duplicates

```{r find-duplicate, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

???

From the passenger's point of view, we're interested in flight number at its scheduled departure time. So `key = ?`, and `index = ?`. Because it's event data with irregular interval, we have to specify `regular = FALSE`.

Everything looks good to me. Finger crossed.

Oops! We got an error.

The error says: ... and suggests ...

Another way to interpret this error message is that the data set may have data quality issue. Not every data is the iris data set, small and clean. Especially large data sets need somewhat cleaning.

We need to search for those duplicates and hopefully fix them.

---

class: middle

```{r highlight.output = c(4, 8)}
flights %>% 
  duplicates(key = flight_num, index = sched_dep_datetime) %>% 
  print(width = 100)
```

???

As you can see, we've got two problematic data entries. The flight number `NK630` has been scheduled twice at the same departure time. They have identical arrival time, departure delay, arrival delay, and carrier. But they are different in tail number, origin and destination. After researching this flight number and going through the whole database, my decision is to remove the highlighted entry: the flight from LAX to DEN, bc this flight doesn't operate on this route during that period.

---

```{r find-duplicate-lgl}
```

```{r tsibble, echo = TRUE}
```

```{r highlight.output = 1:2}
print(flights_ts, width = 70)
```

???

Once we remove the duplicated observation, we are all settled. A tsibble is created.

The printing method tries to give useful information. The exclamation mark highlights the irregularity, and the time zone associated with the index. and we've got 22 thousands flights as observational units in the table.

???

What I have done so far is going through the tidy stage in order to create the tsibble object. Tsibble complains early when the data involves duplicates, like the flights data. We need to find the duplicates and fix them. We now end up with a properly-defined temporal data.

Tsibble permits time gaps. It is recommended to check time gaps before transformation and modelling. Bc you are likely to encounter errors if gaps in time. Luckily no gaps in this data.

Tsibble provides formal organisation on how to tidy your temporal data.

???

Tsibble is not only a data abstraction, but also a DSL for wrangling temporal data.

Like we can make a plot layer by layer with grammar of graphics, we can chain operation by operation using tsibble to make a complete analysis. Bc the grammar is declarative.

When I actually develop tsibble, I started to appreciate the tidyverse team. Lots of amazing design thinking behind it. A fluent and consistent API gives an intuitive pipeline but it takes lots of time to refine the idea. For example, naminng a thing is difficult.

# .blue[3.] Tsibble rolls with <br> functional programming.

<hr>

### [FP focuses on expressions instead of for-loop statements.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

???

The third aspect of tsibble is adopting FP for rolling windows.

When doing rolling window analysis, we cannot avoid for loops. But tsibble's rolling family keeps users away from for loops. and help concentrate on what you're going to achieve instead of how you're going to achieve.

Another chunk of operations for time series is definitely rolling window. It
not only does iteration over each element like what `purrr::map()` does, but 
also needs to roll. What I'm going to do is to wake up this cat, and let her roll.

A toy example: computing moving averages for window size 2 and median for 3

In order to compute the mean and median, I have to do a bit of setup for the loop. But the only part we're interested is the action: mean and median.

The length of output is not stable, depending on the the choice window size. This is for loop

What I mean by FP? It abstracts away the for-loop, and focus on what you want to do by supplying a function. And it's length-stable and type-stable.

3 types of rolling window

1. sliding: moves a fixed length window through the data with overlapping
2. tiling: moves a fixed length window through the data w/o overlapping
3. stretching: fix an initial window and expand to include more observations.

The animation shows three different rolling averages.

it takes an arbitrary function: simple complex

time series CV: easier to compute forecasting accuracy by comparing rolling forecast with rolling data

...

The only limit for how to use this family for window-related analysis is your imagination.

What's my contribution is:

Tsibble provides a uniform and standardized temporal data structure for downstream analytic tasks. You can easily transform, visualise and model your temporal data, and smoothly shifts between them for rapid iteration to gain data insights.

Tsibble also provides a descriptive grammar that you can express your temporal data analysis problem easily.

Lemme show you a final example to conclude this part by chaining these 3 parts together.

Last year, I said tsibble was going to be the future of time series. This year, I would say the future is around the corner. A few dependent packages have been developed around the tsibble structure, including the new fable package for forecasting to replace the forecast package. Rob has already started teaching this set of cutting-edge tools in his class this semester. The next generation of forecasters will be more productive.
